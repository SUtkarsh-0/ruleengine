 as db_connection_string = "mysql+pymysql://iu4o34rrt1vkbmn5ws1q:pscale_pw_AvEewIlmNnBGI2Q44BcOeeVSzwoWfDaIRkaygc9fS3V@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/utkarshflaskdb?charset=utf8mb4"

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Still needed to add the condition checking functionality and when the code is pushed to git with the db values the connection gets cut off(Don't know why its happening and couldn't solve it ), So use the code in a private system and replace the db_connection_string given above
